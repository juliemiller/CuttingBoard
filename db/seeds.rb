This pizza is adapted from the recipe used by the staff at Robertaâ€™s restaurant in Brooklyn, who make their tomato sauce simply by whizzing together canned tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt.

	description: "I have made several versions of vegetarian chili; in some the beans take center stage, others are just as focused on vegetables. This thick, satisfying chili is equally focused on both. I particularly like the way the sweet flavor and comforting, creamy texture of the winter squash plays against the spicy flavors in the chili.",
