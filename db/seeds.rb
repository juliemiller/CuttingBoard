I can remember a few times in my life: Maldon sea salt, really good dark chocolate, European butter, and most of all, six years ago when we were on our honeymoon in Italy and I tasted buffalo mozzarella for the first time. Previously, I’d had no idea that a buffalo’s finest talent was the ability to produce cheese that is so far superior to a cow’s that it practically deserves its own food group. But on the island of Capri, where we spent 7 blissful days, its famous Caprese salad is made using the creamiest, most mouthwatering buffalo mozzarella and I’ll never forget the taste as long as I live. (It didn’t hurt that we were devouring it while surrounded by ancient buildings covered in bougainvillea and endless ocean views, but that’s beside the point.)"},

   :description=>"Seriously, this is the BEST mac & cheese out there.
I am all about some mac & cheese. However, I am also very picky about my macaroni and cheese dishes. One of my favorite recipes was passed on to me from my mom and it is super easy to make. The secret is to add flour to get your cheese to melt and stick to the pasta properly. Mmmmhmmm makes me hungry just writing about it. Well what are you waiting for? Let’s make some mac & cheese!"},

Last summer, while on vacation with our good friends, we went out for dinner at this little crab shack.  It was a hole-in-the-wall place that came very highly recommended by the locals.  It was the antithesis of fancy — paper table”cloths”, mismatched furniture and no air conditioning – just open windows and the warm ocean breeze.  Ordering was easy, just pick your protein (a selection of fish, shrimp and scallops) from the column on the left of the chalk-board menu and then choose your sauce from the column on the right."},

And once you find the stuff you like after all that hard work, no wonder you don't want to give it up.

I love that this is more of a balanced and filling smoothie with the Greek yogurt and oats – so you get a whole grain, some added protein from the Greek yogurt plus the probiotics that come with it.

With all that hanging around, it felt like the universe was trying to tell me that I should make a good old Cobb salad for dinner, but as it turned out, that was also the weekend of the one significant snowstorm we’ve had all year, and I wanted WARM for supper.  And since eggs are an essential part of the classic Cobb salad, that led me down the road of taking all the delectable elements of a Cobb salad, but taking a different route with the egg part.

Second, using a mandolin will help you slice them paper thin.  Just be sure to use the safety grip provided with the mandolin to protect your fingers."},

After a couple of bad experiences with homemade green monster (kale) smoothies, I’d almost given up on this super food idea until I tried a couple of salads with kale as the base. I’ve never liked cooked “greens” so if I was going to add kale to my diet, it had to remain in the raw state (I think it’s one of those texture things for me!).

   :description=>"These were made for our Oscar Party that I told you about last week, and I think that they were my favorite thing that we made as a whole. When I was in high school, I basically lived on sandwiches. They were much more basic than these pressed picnic sandwiches, but they were my favorite thing to eat – I would usually prefer to make myself a sandwich for dinner (or even breakfast) than have what my mom was making. I’m sure that this was frustrating beyond belief, but my mom always kept our fridge stocked with plenty of cold cuts and cheeses so that I could make my beloved sandwiches. Eventually, I started getting more creative with my sandwiches, and I still love making Kramer a sandwich to bring to work every morning. There’s just something so comforting and simple about a good sandwich, don’t you agree? - See more at: http://www.thecrepesofwrath.com/2011/03/07/pressed-picnic-sandwiches/#sthash.4bpa1Hyx.dpuf"},

   :description=>"Oh fall...the weather turns chilly and life gets busy again and all my family wants to eat are warm, comforting, quick & easy meals. I make a different kind of soup almost every week these days (like this soup, or that soup) because they're such a great way to eat vegetables and they're perfect for reheating for a couple days after they're made. And they're a good choice for lunch or for dinner. My friend Steph from Running Toward The Harvest shared this Easy Mexican Tortilla Soup recipe with me and after one bite I was hooked! This recipe is now one of our favourites, mostly because it is so easy to make and it tastes so great! And it's easy to customize it with everybody's favourite toppings. It's a quick and easy meal that the whole family will love!"},

It’s a great accompaniment for almost any protein – chicken, fish, beef, you name it and this goes with it. I was inspired to make this a few days ago from watching a new-to-me show on Cooking Channel, French Food at Home. I’ve really been enjoying that one and am getting quite interested in French food because of it. And the more I learn about French food, the more I see its influence in Southern cuisine. Really. And not just in Creole (of course), but across the entire spectrum of our varied Southern cuisine. I think I’m going to be exploring French cuisine quite a bit and I hope you won’t mind me posting what I discover."},

   :description=>"t’s no small secret that Wendy’s restaurants make their chili with leftover cooked hamburger patties, not that I am trying to duplicate their flavor here. While I don’t choose to make chili from cooked beef, there have been the occasions where I had leftover burgers for whatever reason and have reimagined them into chili. This is also good if you want to make chili but only have frozen meatballs on hand, as you can thaw them and it works the same (provided they are not coated in sauce). You can also use up leftover meatloaf this way, again, as long as it is not inappropriately covered with a conflicting sauce."},

In our favorite Chicken and Vegetable Potstickers, I combine ground chicken, cabbage, carrots, ginger, garlic, scallions, soy sauce, and toasted sesame oil for a fresh filling that’s big on flavor. These tender, crisp-bottomed dumplings are delicious served alongside a honey-soy dipping sauce, with an optional touch of Sriracha for a light kick. Plus, you can assemble them ahead of time and freeze them for later use, making wholesome, homemade potstickers just as convenient as store-bought. Sounds like a plan to me!"},

   :description=>"People like chili for the same reason they like yoga instructors: they’re both hot and flexible. You can modify chili based on what you’ve got in your fridge or pantry at any given time, which I did. For the recipe below, I swapped out one can of red kidney beans for white beans. Because I am a wild man, I used 1 pound of ground beef, 1/2 pound of ground chorizo chicken and 1/2 pound of ground lamb. The lamb’s flavor was a bit stronger than I’d prefer in a chili, but it was still better than whatever chili you’re making now."},

Pork is briefly pan-fried with garlic then braised for about an hour in sugar, light soy sauce and thick soy sauce. The thick soy sauce used is already blended with some caramel and sugar - this differs from another variety of dark soy sauce known as 老抽 which although dark is not thick in texture.  The 'black soy sauce' can be found overseas in most Asian stores, just make sure the ingredients in the soy sauce include caramel and sugar.  The thick soy sauce and the sugar together produce an extremely delicious and gorgeous caramelized glaze to the pork.  "},

   :description=>"I love fruit cobbler. It is the perfect desert for any season or occasion! Dress it up, dress it down – either way it is awesome. This is one of my favorite recipes, and I just put in whatever fruit I have. I love to use what is in season, so apples have been the choice lately. I can’t wait for spring fruits! I also love to use frozen, just use them straight out of the freezer. This time I made it I divided it up into 10 individual ramekins that were oh-so-adorable!!"},

One of the stations was the take out pizza counter where we got to throw personal pizzas into the 500F+ stone pizza oven and watch them magically puff and crisp to golden melty perfection in 7 minutes. The take out pizza counter also offered fresh panini for those not in the mood for pizza. The panini menu changed daily, and one day we offered pizza panini. Thick sourdough bread stuffed with mozzarella cheese and pepperoni, served with spicy marinara sauce for dipping. This quickly became my favorite, and I ordered it every time it was on offer. Yes, I passed up the brick oven thin crust pizza in favor of the pressed sandwich. Since I worked at the pizza counter, I was able to customize my pizza panini with mushrooms instead of pepperoni and sauce in the sandwich instead of on the side."},
